title: "Data Acquisition"

Since working groups may ask us to get and wrangle data from some popular databases, this page serves as a guide on acquiring data from said databases! Below are some common places where groups have asked us to request from. Please feel free to add more to the growing list as we collaborate with more and more groups.

## TRY Plant Trait Database

### Guide

The [TRY database](https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Home.php) offers a wide variety of plant trait data for many species. As of 2023, the database contains over 15 million trait records for over 300 thousand plant taxa. 

#### **1. Account Registration**

To get started, first [create an account on TRY](https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/RegStart.php). After filling out the required fields, TRY will send an email to you with your password. Log in with your email and password.

#### **2. Terms and Conditions**

After logging in for the first time, TRY will direct you to its Intellectual Property Guidelines. Scroll down and click 'I accept' to proceed.

#### **3. Start a Data Request and Select Traits**

TRY will then redirect you to the [Request Data](https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Prop2.php) page to begin a new request. This page can also be accessed by clicking "Data Portal" > "TRY Database". The recommendation is to request by traits/species.

Then enter the numeric IDs of the traits you want data for. For example, plant height has the IDs 3106 (Plant height vegetative) and 3107 (Plant height generative).

The list of all trait IDs is [here](https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Prop023.php). There is also an option on the page to download a .txt file of all the traits.

#### **4. Select Species**

Next, you will be prompted to select the species you want data for. Each species is associated with a numeric ID, so enter the desired IDs in the field below. For example, 29 represents Abies alba and 56 represents Abies lasiocarpa. 

The list of all plant IDs is [here](https://www.try-db.org/dnld/TryAccSpecies.txt). Again, you also have the option to download a .txt file of all the plant species in case you wish to get the IDs programmatically.

#### **5. Choose Data Type: Public or Private**

Then, you must choose whether you want to request public data or public+private data. The former option will get you the data faster, while the latter option may take up to 14 days because the dataset custodians must respond to your request. 

In our previous experience, requesting public data usually gets you the data within 24 hours.

#### **6. Describe Data Request**

Once you have chosen which type of data you want, you will be prompted to enter the title and description of your project. These fields will be necessary if you requested for public+private data since the dataset custodians will need a reason to make their data available for your request.

#### **7. Add Coauthors**

Add any relevant coauthors to your request before proceeding. It's a good idea to add your fellow data analysts and/or working group PIs.

#### **8. Finish Request and Wait**

Your request is now complete! You will receive an email from TRY notifiying you that they have received your request. Wait for a subsequent email from them to get the actual download link to the data.

### Relevant example

See our [GitHub issue #122](https://github.nceas.ucsb.edu/LTER/lter-wg-scicomp/issues/122) and the scripts in this [folder](https://github.com/knigro83/LTER_plant_reproduction/tree/main/traits) for an example on how we pulled and integrated data from the TRY database.

## NEON

### Guide

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a facility that collects long-term ecological data from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in the United States. Their data usually falls into one of three categories: data collected by an airborne observation platform like LIDAR, data collected by a person in the field, or data collected by an automated sensor. 

NEON has a handy [API](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-api-usage) that will allow you to pull their data using R. Additionally, they have created a whole suite of [tutorials](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials) for various needs, including a tutorial on how to [download and explore NEON data](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/download-explore-neon-data) using their helper R packages. 

### Relevant example

See our [NEON tutorial script](https://github.com/NCEAS/scicomptasks/tree/main/misc_neon) in `scicomptasks` for an example on how to handle NEON data with R.
