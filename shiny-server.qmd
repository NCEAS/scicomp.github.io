LTER-related Shiny apps can be deployed on our server at: [https://shiny.lternet.edu/](https://shiny.lternet.edu/)

To deploy your working app, first make sure that all the files live at a GitHub repository. Once our sysadmin Nick Outin has made you an account on the server, you can log in via SSH.

## Log in

For Mac users, open the Terminal app and type the following command, replacing `<YOUR-USERNAME>` with your own username. 
```{bash, eval = F}
ssh <YOUR-USERNAME>@shiny.lternet.edu
```

Windows users can log in with [PuTTY](https://help.nceas.ucsb.edu/NCEAS/Computing/connecting_to_linux_using_ssh?s[]=putty), using shiny.lternet.edu as the host name. 

## Set up proper permissions

### Join `shiny-apps`

A `shiny-apps` user group has been created in this server. Set up the proper permissions for your account by adding yourself to this group with this command. 
```{bash, eval = F}
sudo usermod -aG shiny-apps <YOUR-USERNAME>
```

To decipher this command a bit: `sudo` will enable you to run commands as a user with full control and privileges. The `usermod` command is used to modify user account details. The basic syntax is:
```{bash, eval = F}
usermod [OPTIONS] <YOUR-USERNAME>
```

The `-G` option will add the user to a supplementary group. The `-aG` combined options will add the user to the new supplementary group while also leaving them in the other supplementary group(s) they were already a part of.

As an FYI, the apps on the server will run as the user `shiny`, so `shiny` is also in the `shiny-apps` user group. 

### Allow access to your home directory

Additionally, you need to allow `shiny` access to your user home directory by running:
```{bash, eval = F}
chmod a+x /home/<YOUR-USERNAME>
```

This `chmod` (change mode) command is used to control file permissions. Basic syntax:
```{bash, eval = F}
chmod [OPTIONS] MODE FILE/DIRECTORY
```

There are two "modes" that you can use to set permissions: Symbolic and Octal mode. The Symbolic mode uses operators and letters. For example, the `a` option denotes all the owner/groups the file/directory belongs to. The `+` operator grants the permission, and the letter `x` stands for the execute permission. 


## Tell `git` who you are

Now that your account has the proper permissions, use the `git config` commands to tell `git` who you are.

```{bash, eval = F}
git config --global user.name "<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>"
git config --global user.email "<YOUR-GITHUB-EMAIL>"
```

You can check to see if you entered your details correctly by entering `git config --list`.

## Copy your app to the server

The easiest way to get all the files for your app to the server is by `git clone`. 

If you like, you can create a folder named "github" to store all your future apps. For example, in the screenshot below, I created a "github" folder using the `mkdir` command in my home directory.

To check that the folder was created, I can list all the files/folders in this directory with `ls`. Since I want my app to be inside the "github" folder, I used the `cd` command to change my directory. 

Finally, `git clone` the GitHub repo that has all the files for your app. Here, I am cloning the [`lterpalettefinder-shiny` repo](https://github.com/lter/lterpalettefinder-shiny) to my local directory on the virtual machine as `lterpalettefinder`.

You can go one level above the current directory by typing `cd ..`

## Install necessary R packages

After you cloned the repository for your app, you can start installing the necessary R packages! To make these packages available for all users, you will want to switch over to the `root` user with the `sudo -i` command. Then open R by simply typing `R` and install packages with the usual `install.packages()` function.

### Missing dependencies? 

If you run into an error installing a R package, it's likely because the server does not have the required dependencies installed yet. 

For example, I wanted to install the `lterpalettefinder` R package, but I got lots of errors on missing dependencies instead. 

<img src="images/shiny-server/shiny-server-3.png" align="center" width="100%"/>

I saw that the `curl` dependency was missing, so I attempted to install that. However, R gives me another error.

Looking closer, it asks me to install `libcurl4-openssl-dev` first. To install this Ubuntu package, I exited R with `q()` and logged off `root` with `exit`. Once I'm back in my own user profile, I can use the `sudo apt-get install` command to install `libcurl4-openssl-dev`.

If you get these prompts to restart services, you can tap Return/Enter to continue the installation.

Afterwards, `libcurl4-openssl-dev` installed successfully, and then I can finally install the missing `curl` dependency in R!

You can repeat a similar process to find and install the rest of the required dependencies before you are able to install certain R packages.
