    "markdown": "\nThe [`googledrive` R package](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/) is a package that lets R users directly interact with files on GoogleDrive. This can be extremely useful because it lets all members of a team share the same source data file(s) and guarantees that updates to \"living\" documents are received by all group members the next time they run their R script. This package is technically part of the Tidyverse but is not loaded by running `library(tidyverse)`.\n\nBecause this package requires access to an R user's GoogleDrive, you must \"authenticate\" the `googledrive` package. This essentially tells Google that it is okay if an R package uses your credentials to access and (potentially) modify your Drive content. There are only a few steps to this process but follow along with the below tutorial and we'll get you ready to integrate the Google Drive into your code workflows using the `googledrive` package in no time!\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nTo follow along with this tutorial you will need to take the following steps:\n\n- [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/)\n\n- [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)\n\n- Create a Gmail account\n\nFeel free to skip any steps that you have already completed!\n\n### Authorize `googledrive`\n\n\nIn order to connect R with a GoogleDrive, we'll need to authorize `googledrive` to act on our behalf. This only needs to be done once (per computer) so follow along and you'll be building GoogleDrive into your workflows in no time!\n\nFirst, **install the `googledrive` and `httpuv` R packages**. The `googledrive` package's need is self-evident while the `httpuv` package makes the following steps a little easier than `googledrive` makes it alone.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\"googledrive\", \"httpuv\"))\n```\n:::\n\nOnce you've installed the packages we can begin the authentication in R using the `drive_auth` function in the `googledrive` package.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngoogledrive::drive_auth(email = \"enter your gmail here!\")\n```\n:::\n\nIf this is your *first time* using `googledrive`, `drive_auth` will kick you to a new tab of your browser (see below for a screen grab of that screen) where you can pick which Gmail you'd like to connect to R.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/tutorial_drive-auth/drive-auth-1.png\" width = \"50%\" />\n</p>\n\n**Click the Gmail you want to use** and you will get a second screen where Google tells you that \"Tidyverse API\" wants access to your Google Account. This message is followed by three checkboxes, the first two are grayed out but the third is unchecked.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/tutorial_drive-auth/drive-auth-2.png\" width = \"50%\" />\n</p>\n\n:::callout-important\n### NOTE\nThis next bit is vitally important so *carefully* read and follow the next instruction!\n:::\n\nIn this screen, **you must check the unchecked box** to be able to use the `googledrive` R package. If you do not check this box all attempts to use `googledrive` functions will get an error that says \"insufficient permissions\".\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/tutorial_drive-auth/drive-auth-3.png\" width = \"50%\" />\n</p>\n\nWhile granting access to \"see, edit, create, and \"delete\" all of your Google Drive files\" sounds like a significant security risk, those powers are actually why you're using the `googledrive` package in the first place! You want to be able to download existing Drive files, change them in R on your computer, and then put them back in Google Drive which is exactly what is meant by \"see, edit, create, and delete\".\n\nAlso, this power *only applies to the computer you're currently working on!* Granting access on your work computer allows **only** that computer to access your Drive files. So don't worry about giving access to your Drive to the whole world, that is protected by the same failsafes that you use when you let your computer remember a password to a website you frequent.\n\n*After* you've checked the authorization box, **scroll down and click the \"Continue\" button**.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/tutorial_drive-auth/drive-auth-4.png\" width = \"50%\" />\n</p>\n\nThis should result in a plain text page that tells you to close this window and return to R. If you see this message you are ready to use the `googledrive` package!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/tutorial_drive-auth/drive-auth-5.png\" width = \"75%\" />\n</p>\n\n\n\n### Supplementary Information\n\nIf you have tried to use `drive_auth` and *did not* check the box indicated above, you need to make the `googledrive` package ask you again. Using `drive_auth` will not (annoyingly) return you to the place it sent you the first time. However, if you run the following code chunk it should give you another chance to check the needed box.\n\nThe [`gargle` R package](https://gargle.r-lib.org/) referenced below is required for interacting with Google Application Program Interfaces (APIs). This package does the heavy lifting of secure password and token management and is necessary for the `googledrive` authentication chunk below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngoogledrive::drive_auth(\n  email = gargle::gargle_oauth_email(),\n  path = NULL,\n  scopes = \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\",\n  cache = gargle::gargle_oauth_cache(),\n  use_oob = gargle::gargle_oob_default(),\n  token = NULL)\n```\n:::\n\n\n Unfortunately, to use the `googledrive` package you *must* check the box that empowers the package to function as designed. If you're uncomfortable giving the `googledrive` that much power you will need to pivot your workflow away from using GoogleDrive directly. However, NCEAS does offer access to an [internal server called \"Aurora\"](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp-workshop-collaborative-coding/server.html) where data can be securely saved and shared among group members without special authentication like what `googledrive` requires. Reach out to our team if this seems like a more attractive option for your working group and we can offer training on how to use this powerful tool!\n",
