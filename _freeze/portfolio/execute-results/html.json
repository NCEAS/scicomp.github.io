To that end, we have created the R package [`scicomptools`](https://github.com/NCEAS/scicomptools#readme)!\n\n#### Installation Instructions\n\nTo install the package in R, use the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"NCEAS/scicomptools\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Package Description\n\nThis package contains a diverse mix of functions for everything from repetitive data wrangling tasks to checking whether you have a token attached for GitHub. In addition, functions that we wrote that are deprecated (usually because their internal workings have been superseded by packages on CRAN) are removed from the package but retained in the GitHub repository in case they are useful to you! **All functions--both live and deprecated--are summarized in the README on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NCEAS/scicomptools) so take a look!**\n\n## R Shiny Apps\n\nOur team created another R package--`lterpalettefinder`--to extract color palettes from user-supplied photos. To help non-R users still explore this package and have fun pulling color palettes from photos, we created [this standalone Shiny app](https://cosima.nceas.ucsb.edu/lterpalettefinder-shiny/). This app lets anyone interact with `lterpalettefinder` via their browser with no R experience required!\n\nWe have also built apps to help working groups visualize data or present survey results in an interactive, visually-appealing format. Shiny apps can also include useful 'overview' portions that serve as an excellent landing page for third parties to your group's activities!\n\n## Project Websites\n\nOur team also helped build [a website](https://lter.github.io/som-website/index.html) for the Soil Organic Matter (SOM) working group. One of this group's primary products was a synthesized data package containing observed data, modifications of that data, and models based on them. The website operates in part to publicize this data product but also to provide a central location for other resources developed by or important to the SOM group. \n\nFor your group we can (if desired):\n\n- Build a website using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)\n    - All website content creation can be done via RStudio which your group may already be somewhat familiar with\n    - Quarto also offers a new \"visual editor\" that lets you format text as you would in any word processor (i.e., Microsoft Word, Pages, etc.)\n- Maintain the website **OR** help *you* to maintain it\n    - Quarto is written entirely in \"Markdown syntax\" which makes it easily maintained by either our team or yours depending on your preference\n    - We have also created a [tutorial on making websites with Quarto](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/tutorials.html#building-a-website-with-quarto) that you are welcome to explore!\n\n## Spatial Analyses & Wrangling\n\nOur team has also been instrumental in acquiring, wrangling, and summarizing spatial data. For the Silica Exports working group we developed a workflow (see [here](https://github.com/lter/lterwg-si-export)) that accomplishes the following tasks:\n\n1. Creates shapefiles that identify the drainage basin linked to several hundred stream gages\n\n2. \"Cookie cuts\" spatial data within those drainage basins (e.g., land cover, lithology, precipitation, etc.)\n\n3. Summarizes that extracted data both as rasters and as data tables for use as explanatory variables in other analyses\n\nWe are comfortable working with such data and can help your team acquire and/or process spatial data if that is of interest!\n",
