## What We Do

The Scientific Computing team is a small (but mighty!) team of data analysts/scientists working at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)). We provide modern technological infrastructure to support your analytical and other computing or network-based needs. In addition to the technical support during your visit at NCEAS, our scientific computing team is available to discuss and advise on data science and scientific programming tasks, such as:

- Structuring and integrating heterogeneous datasets
- Writing code to wrangle, analyze, model, or visualize the data your group has already collected
- Designing workflows, scripting best practices for reproducible science, and reviewing code
- Helping you get set up on NCEAS' server
- Preserving and promoting your products on the Web - from derived datasets and terminological glossaries/vocabularies, to scripts, model codes, and interactive "web applications"
- Offering workshops on new skills or programs

Depending on your team's preferences, we can operate on a spectrum of independence ranging from complete self-sufficiency after initial definition of task scope to coding together with your team.

Contact [our team](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/staff.html) with your requests at scicomp@nceas.ucsb.edu

## Our Role

Currently we are only supporting [Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network](https://lternet.edu/) synthesis working groups. The LTER Network Office (LNO) regularly issues calls for synthesis working group proposals, which are open to scientists from within and outside of the LTER Network. The LNO, which operates out of NCEAS, fosters enhanced communication, collaboration, synthesis, training, and engagement across the network through these working groups. For more information, visit the LTER website on the [current LTER working groups](https://lternet.edu/current-working-groups/).

## Navigating this Website

### If you're a working group member...

For members of our working groups, this website is a centralized hub of resources designed to help you get familiar with the way our team works and what we offer. The pages under the **Working Group Onboarding** tab contain materials that will facilitate collaboration between our team and your group! 

Visit [**Working Together**](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/services.html) for more details on the types of tasks we can help with. 

For information on the modern technological infrastructure that NCEAS provides, check out [**NCEAS Infrastructure**](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/infrastructure.html).

To see a list of the supported, collaborative tools that our team uses, visit [**Suggested Tools**](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/suggested-tools.html).

For other miscellaneous resources, see [**Other Resources**](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/other-materials.html).

We look forward to assisting your group however we can! Please do not hesitate to contact [our team](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/staff.html) for any task requests and questions. 

### For working groups and all our other visitors...

Welcome! Even if you're not a part of a synthesis working group, we hope that you find the various resources on this website helpful! Please feel free to take a look at our [**Workshops**](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/workshops.html) on GitHub, `tidyverse`, and R Shiny apps! Or peruse our [**Tutorials**](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/tutorials.html) and [**Best Practices**](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/best_practices.html) pages for other useful tips in R.
