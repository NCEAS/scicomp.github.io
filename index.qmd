## What We Do

We are a small (but mighty!) team of data scientists working at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)).

### Below section taken from Programming Support page but may fit here


 We provide modern technological infrastructure to support your analytical and other computing or network-based needs. In addition to the technical support during your visit at NCEAS, our scientific computing team is available to discuss and advise on data science and scientific programming tasks, such as:

- Organizing and assembling your data
- Assistance with data harmonization and documentation
- Structuring and integrating heterogeneous datasets
- Modeling and analysis of your data
- Scaling your analysis using NCEAS' analytical server
- Scripting best practices and reviewing code
- Preserving and promoting your products on the Web - from derived datasets and terminological glossaries/vocabularies, to scripts, model codes, and interactive “web applications”
- Contact [our team](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/staff.html) with your requests at scicomp@nceas.ucsb.edu


### Leftover stuff from old version of this page that might also fit here

- Offering **workshops** on new skills or programs
- Helping you get set up on **NCEAS' server**
- **Acquiring data** from third parties
- **Writing code** to wrangle, analyze, or visualize the data your group has already collected
- And so much more!

Depending on your team's preferences, we can operate on a spectrum of independence ranging from complete self-sufficiency after initial definition of task scope to coding together with your team.

## Our Role

Might make sense to explain here which working group types we support? Then we can easily add or remove modules if our position(s) at NCEAS change and we wind up supporting more types of workshops
