Because we live in an era where we may only meet in person sporadically, we felt it would be nice to introduce ourselves here to help you put a face to the emails / Slack messages / GitHub issues we exchange going forward! If you would like to email the whole team as one send your questions to **scicomp@nceas.ucsb.edu**
